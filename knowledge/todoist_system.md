# My GTD System

**Last updated:** 2025-10-15
**Purpose:** This document defines the foundational structure of my personal GTD system in Todoist.

---

## Projects (Workflow States)

Projects represent **stages in the GTD workflow**, not traditional "projects":

- **#inbox**: All new items land here first (capture phase)
- **#processed**: Most inbox items end up here (active, actionable tasks)
- **#routine**: Recurring tasks and habits
- **#reminder**: Date-based reminders (often paired with another task)
- **#questions**: Things I need to ask/clarify with someone
- **#groceries**: Shopping list (bypass GTD processing - just a list)

---

## Contexts (Primary Organization)

Contexts are the **real organizing principle** of this system. They define WHERE, HOW, WITH WHOM, or WHEN a task can be done.

### Location Contexts
- **@home**: Tasks done at home
- **@house**: Tasks done inside
- **@yard**: Outdoor/garden tasks
- **@errand**: General tasks requiring going out
- **@bunnings**: Specific errand at Bunnings (hardware store)
- **@parents**: Errands/tasks to do at parents' house (Wendy & Ian)

### Activity Contexts
- **@computer**: Digital work/tasks
- **@email**: Email-specific actions
- **@call**: Phone calls needed
- **@chore**: Household chores
- **@maintenance**: Home/car/equipment maintenance

### People Contexts
- **@bec**: Tasks involving Bec (wife)
- **@william**: Tasks involving William (oldest son)
- **@reece**: Tasks involving Reece (middle son)
- **@alex**: Tasks involving Alex (youngest son)
- **@parents**: Also used as errand context (things to do at their house)

### Special Contexts
- **@waiting**: Waiting on someone/something (delegated or blocked)
- **@weather**: Weather-dependent tasks (can't do if raining, etc.)

### Energy Contexts
- **@lowenergy**: tasks that don't take a lot of energy to complete
- **@medenergy**: Tasks that take a medium amount of energy
- **@highenergy**: Tasks that take a lot of energy whether that be physical or mental

### Duration Contexts:
- **@short**: Tasks that dont take a lot of time
- **@medium**: Tasks that take about 15mins - 1h
- **@long**: Tasks that take over an hour to complete
---

## Context Combination Rules

**Contexts are combinable** for nuanced organization:

- "Sweep under dining room table" → **@home @chore**
- "Fertilise lawn" → **@yard @chore @weather**
- "Buy paint at Bunnings" → **@bunnings @errand**
- "Ask Bec about dinner plans" → **@bec @call**
- "Fix leaking tap" → **@home @maintenance**

**Principle:** Use multiple contexts to capture all the conditions needed to do the task.

---

## Priority Philosophy

**Priorities are sacred** - use sparingly to keep the priority space clean.

- **Default:** No priority (P4 or none) for most tasks
- **Use only when:** Task is truly critical and needs elevation above others
- **Principle:** Don't pollute priority space with routine/normal tasks
- **Effect:** When you DO set a priority, it actually means something
- **Ranking:** (No priority or P4), P3 important, P2 must do, P1 critical.

---

## Due Date Philosophy


- **Use for:** What i plan to do tasks.
- **Don't use for:** Soft goals are fine and for planning my day using dates are also fine
- **imporant dates:** Important dates will have a corresponding priority level depending on their importance

---

## Reminder Task Pattern

For appointments or time-sensitive events that need a notification:

**Create TWO tasks:**
1. **Main task** (if actionable) → appropriate project + contexts
2. **Reminder task** → #reminder project, due date + notification time

**Example:** Doctor appointment on Thursday at 2pm
- Task 1: "Doctor appointment - Dr. Smith" → #processed @errand @waiting
- Task 2: "REMINDER: Doctor appointment 2pm" → #reminder, due: Thursday, reminder: 1:30pm

**Rationale:** Separates the actionable task from the time-based notification.

---

## Inbox Processing Flow

Standard GTD clarify phase, adapted to this system:

1. **New item** → #inbox
2. **Clarify: What is this?**
   - Grocery item? → #groceries (skip GTD processing)
   - Question for someone? → #questions + @person
   - Recurring task? → #routine
   - Just a reminder? → #reminder
   - Actionable task? → #processed + appropriate contexts
3. **Add appropriate contexts** (combine if needed)
4. **Set priority** ONLY if critical
5. **Set due date** ONLY if must be done that day
6. **Create reminder task** if appointment/time-sensitive

---

## Special Cases

### Groceries
- **Bypass GTD:** Shopping lists are not "tasks" in the GTD sense
- **Action:** Add directly to #groceries project, no contexts needed
- **Format:** Simple item names ("Milk", "Bread", "Eggs")

### Questions
- **Pattern:** "Ask [person] about [topic]"
- **Project:** #questions
- **Contexts:** @person (and @call if phone-based)
- **Example:** "Ask Bec about dinner plans" → #questions @bec

### Waiting
- **Use @waiting for:** Tasks blocked by someone else
- **Combine with people:** "@waiting @bec" = waiting on Bec
- **Principle:** Track delegated or dependent tasks

## System Principles

1. **Projects = workflow stages**, not traditional projects
2. **Contexts = primary organization** (where/how/who)
3. **Priorities are sacred** (use sparingly)
4. **Due dates are hard deadlines** (not soft goals)
5. **Contexts combine** for nuanced task definition
6. **Groceries bypass GTD** (different mental model)
7. **Reminders are separate tasks** (in #reminder project)
