# Synapse Project - Claude Workflow Instructions

## Git Workflow

**ALWAYS commit AND push changes automatically** - don't ask, just do it:
- When you complete work on a feature/fix, commit it
- Immediately follow the commit with `git push`
- User prefers commits to be pushed automatically as part of normal workflow
- Only ask about git operations if they're destructive (force push, hard reset, etc.)

## Todo List Usage

- Use TodoWrite for multi-step tasks to track progress
- Mark todos as completed immediately when done
- Keep user informed of progress through the todo list
