# Token Optimization - Current State Assessment
**Date**: 2025-10-19
**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è UNSTABLE - Code split incomplete, agent broken

---

## Summary

You're at a **partially complete** state that needs cleanup before moving forward. The good news: Phase 1-2 optimizations are solid and working. The bad news: Phase 3 code split (Mini-Project 002) was started but **not completed**, leaving the system in a broken state.

---

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED & STABLE

### Phase 1: System Prompt & Schema Optimization (COMMITTED)
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Complete, tested, committed to git
- **Savings**: 38% token reduction (~2,000 tokens/call)
- **Files**: Safely in git (commits 8957739, 29e7e11)
- **What works**:
  - Literal type extraction (enum values in schemas)
  - Compressed system prompt (1,254 ‚Üí 400 tokens)
  - 97% cache hit rate
- **Tests**: ‚úÖ Passed validation

### Documentation Consolidation (Mini-Project 001)
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Complete
- **Savings**: 60% reduction in workflow docs (302 lines ‚Üí consolidated)
- **File**: `.claude/claude.md` created
- **Impact**: Faster context loading for AI assistants

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIALLY COMPLETE (UNSTABLE)

### Code Split (Mini-Project 002)
- **Status**: ‚ùå **BROKEN** - Only 3 of 6 modules created
- **What exists**:
  - `core/agents/todoist/__init__.py` ‚úÖ (but incomplete imports)
  - `core/agents/todoist/core.py` ‚ö†Ô∏è (has import errors)
  - `core/agents/todoist/task_management.py` ‚úÖ (created)
- **What's MISSING**:
  - `knowledge.py` - NOT created
  - `quick_capture.py` - NOT created
  - `wizards.py` - NOT created
  - `gtd_workflow.py` - NOT created

**Current Error**:
```
‚ùå Error loading agent: name 'timezone_module' is not defined
```

**Root Cause**: The code split was started but never completed. Only task_management.py was fully extracted, leaving the core.py in an incomplete state with broken imports and missing method definitions.

### Docstring Compression (Mini-Project 003)
- **Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **UNCLEAR** - May have been applied to incomplete modules
- **Estimated savings**: ~600 tokens (IF complete)
- **Problem**: Can't verify because agent won't load

### Task Data Compression (Mini-Project 004)
- **Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **UNCLEAR** - `_compress_task()` method may exist but untested
- **Estimated savings**: ~2,300-4,600 tokens (IF complete)
- **Problem**: Can't verify because agent won't load

## üî¥ CONTAMINATION: Model Routing Changes

### Unwanted Changes in Git Working Tree
The model routing work (which you rejected) left behind changes:
- `core/main.py` - has routing code that references undefined functions
- `agents/todoist.yaml` - model changed to "auto"
- `agents/shell.yaml` - untracked file
- Several other untracked files from routing attempt

**Action needed**: Revert these changes

---

## Current File State

### Git Status
```
Modified (not committed):
  - .claude/claude.md
  - TOKEN_OPTIMIZATION_STATUS.md (outdated)
  - agents/todoist.yaml (has unwanted "auto" model change)
  - core/main.py (has broken routing code)

Untracked (not committed):
  - core/agents/todoist/ (incomplete module split)
  - core/agents/todoist.py.backup (backup of original)
  - mini-projects/*.md (all planning docs)
  - LONG_TERM_TOKEN_OPTIMIZATION_STRATEGY.md
  - agents/shell.yaml
  - Other temporary files
```

### What This Means
- ‚ùå **Agent is broken**: todoist agent won't start
- ‚ùå **Can't test**: No way to verify optimizations work
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Contaminated**: Model routing code mixed in
- ‚úÖ **Can recover**: Original todoist.py.backup exists
- ‚úÖ **Phase 1 safe**: Early work is committed to git

---

## Recovery Options

### Option 1: Complete the Code Split (3-4 hours)
**Pros**:
- Gets you the full 77% token savings for focused work
- Finishes what was started
- Module structure is good for maintenance

**Cons**:
- Takes time to complete all 6 modules
- Need to test each module carefully
- Risk of more bugs during completion

**Steps**:
1. Fix `core.py` import errors
2. Create missing modules (knowledge, quick_capture, wizards, gtd_workflow)
3. Wire up `__init__.py` with all imports
4. Test each tool method works
5. Validate token savings
6. Commit clean state

### Option 2: Rollback to Working State (15 minutes) ‚≠ê RECOMMENDED
**Pros**:
- Fast, gets you to known-good state immediately
- Can start new direction on solid footing
- Keep Phase 1 optimizations (38% savings)

**Cons**:
- Lose potential 77% code split savings
- Docstring/task compression work is lost
- Back to monolithic todoist.py (2,897 lines)

**Steps**:
1. Restore original todoist.py from backup
2. Delete incomplete `core/agents/todoist/` directory
3. Revert core/main.py and agents/todoist.yaml
4. Clean up untracked files
5. Test agent loads and works
6. Commit clean state with Phase 1 only

### Option 3: Hybrid - Keep Task Compression Only (1 hour)
**Pros**:
- Restore working agent quickly
- Keep task data compression (~2,300 tokens) if it exists
- Simpler than full code split

**Cons**:
- Need to manually merge `_compress_task()` into original file
- May not be worth the effort
- Still need to test thoroughly

---

## Recommended Path Forward

### Immediate Actions (Choose One)

#### Path A: Start Fresh Direction (RECOMMENDED for your use case)
1. **Rollback** (Option 2 above) - 15 minutes
2. **Clean git state** - Remove untracked optimization files
3. **Commit stable baseline** - Phase 1 only (38% savings)
4. **Start new direction** - On solid footing

#### Path B: Complete Optimizations First
1. **Complete code split** (Option 1) - 3-4 hours
2. **Validate all optimizations** - 1 hour
3. **Commit stable state** - 70%+ savings
4. **Then start new direction**

---

## Test Plan (Once Stable)

### Phase 1 Validation (Already Working)
```bash
# Test agent loads
./synapse todoist
> help
> exit

# Check token usage
./synapse todoist
> list my inbox tasks
# Verify: ~3,200 tokens (vs ~5,200 before)
> exit
```

### Phase 2-4 Validation (If Code Split Completed)
```bash
# Test all tool categories work
./synapse todoist
> get current time               # Core module
> list tasks project:"Inbox"     # Task management module
> query knowledge learned_rules  # Knowledge module
> capture test task              # Quick capture module
# ... test each module's tools

# Verify token savings
# Expected: ~800-1,200 tokens per focused operation
# (vs ~2,897 lines in full file)
```

### Integration Tests Needed
**File**: `tests/test_token_optimization_integration.py`

**Tests to create**:
1. **test_agent_loads_successfully()** - Agent initializes without errors
2. **test_all_tools_callable()** - Every tool method exists and is callable
3. **test_task_data_compression()** - list_tasks returns compressed format
4. **test_docstring_compression()** - Tool schemas use 1-line descriptions
5. **test_method_attachment()** - Methods from all modules are attached
6. **test_token_baseline()** - Actual token usage < 4,000 per simple query
7. **test_cache_hit_rate()** - Cache hits > 90%

**Execution**:
- You design the test structure
- Hand off to faster AI (Haiku/mini) for implementation
- Run tests before considering optimization "done"

## Stability Assessment

### Are we at a stable point?

**Current**: ‚ùå **NO** - Agent is broken, can't run

**After Rollback (Option 2)**: ‚úÖ **YES**
- Phase 1 (38% savings) committed and working
- All original functionality intact
- Safe to start new direction

**After Code Split (Option 1)**: ‚úÖ **YES** (if done correctly)
- 70%+ token savings
- Modular, maintainable codebase
- But requires 3-4 hours + testing

---

## Next Steps

### My Recommendation

Given you want to "start a new direction" and need "solid footing":

1. **Rollback to Option 2** (15 minutes)
   - Restore working todoist.py
   - Keep Phase 1 optimizations (38% savings is still excellent)
   - Clean up git working tree

2. **Commit clean baseline** (5 minutes)
   - Commit documentation consolidation
   - Commit current stable state
   - Tag as "stable-phase-1-complete"

3. **Archive optimization work** (2 minutes)
   - Move mini-projects/ to docs/archive/token-optimization/
   - Keep for future reference
   - Not blocking your working tree

4. **Start new direction** (now ready)
   - Clean git state
   - Working agent
   - 38% token savings locked in
   - Can return to optimizations later if needed

**Total time**: 22 minutes to stable state

## Files to Keep vs Delete

### Keep (Archive)
- `LONG_TERM_TOKEN_OPTIMIZATION_STRATEGY.md` ‚Üí docs/archive/
- `mini-projects/*.md` ‚Üí docs/archive/token-optimization/
- Phase 1 git commits (already safe)

### Delete/Revert
- `core/agents/todoist/` (incomplete module split)
- `agents/shell.yaml` (untracked, from unwanted routing)
- Revert `core/main.py` (remove routing code)
- Revert `agents/todoist.yaml` (remove "auto" model)

### Update
- `TOKEN_OPTIMIZATION_STATUS.md` - Mark as "Phase 1 complete, Phase 2-4 deferred"
- `.claude/claude.md` - Keep (already working)

---

## Questions for You

1. **Do you want to rollback to stable (Option 2)** and start your new direction?
2. **OR complete the code split first (Option 1)** before new direction?

**My strong recommendation**: Option 2 (rollback). You get:
- Stable state in 15 minutes
- 38% token savings retained (significant win)
- Clean slate for new work
- Can revisit code split later if needed

Let me know which path you'd like, and I'll execute it immediately.
