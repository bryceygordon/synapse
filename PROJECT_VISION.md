# Project Vision Statement: Synapse

## Vision
To create a modular, command-line-first AI orchestration engine built on an object-oriented foundation. Each agent in the Synapse ecosystem is a distinct Python **class instance**, whose attributes are loaded from a configuration file and whose **methods are its tools**. The initial version of Synapse will instantiate a **Master Coder Agent**, a powerful and reliable partner capable of autonomously handling the complete test-develop-commit-push lifecycle by invoking its own methods based on AI-driven decisions.

## Core Principles
1.  **Agents as Objects**: The core abstraction is the Agent class. The engine's primary role is to instantiate and orchestrate these agent objects, providing strong encapsulation of logic and state.
2.  **Configuration as Initialization**: A YAML file is not just a collection of settings; it is the blueprint for an agent's `__init__` method. It defines the initial state and attributes of an agent object.
3.  **Methods as Tools**: An agent's capabilities are not external, loosely-coupled functions. They are methods implemented directly on the agent's class. A tool call from the AI becomes a direct method invocation on the agent instance (e.g., `coder_agent.run_tests()`).
4.  **Developer-Centricity**: The first and only goal of this iteration is to perfect the `CoderAgent` class and its methods, making it a world-class assistant for software development.
5.  **Reliability and Transparency**: The engine will be built with robust error handling, clear logging, and transparent CLI feedback. The user will always know which agent object is active and which method is being invoked.
